DSCI 573 lab4 for Group: **Jenson Chang, Catherine Meng, Jingyuan Wang, Zejiao Zeng**

This project addresses a binary classification problem: predicting whether a credit card client will default on their payment in the next month. It uses the [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset), which contains 30,000 records and 24 features, including demographic information, payment history, and billing amounts from April to September 2005.

The target variable is default.payment.next.month, indicating whether the client defaulted. The remaining features provide monthly financial and repayment data that help inform this prediction task.

This dataset was originally featured in a [research study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719) comparing classification models for default prediction. Results in this project may be compared against findings from the paper.
